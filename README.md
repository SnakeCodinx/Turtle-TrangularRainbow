# Trangular Spiral

This code uses the Python Turtle library to create a stunning, swirling pattern that appears to pull the viewer in, like a vortex. The pattern is formed by drawing a series of connected lines with increasing lengths, with each line being drawn in a different color from a predefined palette. The turtle module is used to control the turtle's movements and appearance.
